### [Open Government Data Toolkit](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org): [Open Data Defined](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html)

The term **Open Data** has a very precise meaning. Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

1. The data must be _legally open_, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.
2. The data must be _technically open_, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. To make Open Data easier to find, most organizations create and manage Open Data catalogs.
