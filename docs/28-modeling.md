## What is modeling in EDA

Model is a simple summary of data

Goal: A simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. Ideally, the model will capture true “signals” (i.e. patterns generated by the phenomenon of interest), and ignore “noise” (i.e. random variation that you’re not interested in).

```r
df0 <- as_tibble(iris) %>% filter(Species != "setosa")
```

Let us look at two charts.



```r
df0 %>% ggplot(aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length)) + geom_point()
```

```

## Linear Model: Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width


```r
df0 %>% lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, .)
#> 
#> Call:

#> 
#> Coefficients:
#> (Intercept)  Petal.Width  
#>       2.224        1.600
```



## Formula: $\text{Petal.Length} = 2.224 + 1.600\cdot \text{Petal.Width}$

## Formula: $\text{Sepal.Length} = 3.093 + 1.103\cdot \text{Sepal.Width}$

## Linear Model Basics: y ~ x

```
lm(y~x, data)
```
```
data %>% lm(y~x, .)
```

y-intercept, and slope: rate of increase or decrease


```
summary(lm(y~x, data))
```
```
data %>% lm(y~x, .) %>% summary()
```

(Multiple) R Squared: a value between 0 and 1, the model's strength. It is a measurement of the model quality. If the value is close to 1, the model quality is high. If it is close to 0, the model quality is low.

* $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, $(x_4, y_4)$: Data points
* $\bar{y}$: mean of y = $(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4)/4$.
* $\hat{y}_i$: prediction at $x_i$, 
  - $(x_1, \hat{y}_1)$, $(x_2, \hat{y}_2)$, $(x_3, \hat{y}_3)$, $(x_4, \hat{y}_4)$ are on the regression line.
* $y_1-\hat{y}_1$, $y_2-\hat{y}_2$, $y_2-\hat{y}_2$, $y_2-\hat{y}_2$ are called residues.

## R Squared

$$SS_{tot} = (1-1.25)^2 + (0.5-1.25)^2 + (2-1.25)^2 + (1.5-1.25)^2 = 1.25$$
$$SS_{res} = (1-0.8)^2 + (0.5-1.1)^2 + (2-1.4)^2 + (1.5-1.7)^2 = 0.8$$
$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1- \frac{0.8}{1.25} = 0.36.$$

## Useful Mathematical Formula

* Let $x = c(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ be the independent variable, i.e., Sepal.L
* Let $y = c(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$ be the dependent variable, i.e., Sepal.W
* Let $\mbox{pred} = c(\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \ldots, \hat{y}_n)$ be the predicted values by linear regression.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{slope of the regression line}  &= \frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)} = \frac{cor(x,y)\sqrt{var(y)}}{\sqrt{var(x)}}\\
\mbox{total sum of squares} &= SS_{tot} = \sum_{i}(y_i-mean(y))^2\\
\mbox{residual sum of squares} &= SS_{res} = \sum_{i}(y_i-\mbox{pred}_i)^2 = \sum_{i}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2\\
\mbox{R squared} = R^2 & = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = cor(x,y)^2
\end{aligned}
$$



### Adjusted R Squared

$$\text{Adjusted }R^2 = 1- \frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}$$
$n$: number of observations, the number of rows

$k$: number of variables used for prediction

#> 5  Military expenditures data from SIPRI are derived from the NATO definition, which includes all current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces; defense ministries and other government agencies engaged in defense projects; paramilitary forces, if these are judged to be trained and equipped for military operations; and military space activities. Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions of military personnel and social services for personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)

It also includes most expenditures on national defense and security, but excludes government military expenditures that are part of government capital formation.

It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Divide total government expenditure for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) by the GDP, and multiply by 100. A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries. Limitations: In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refers only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries which may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities.
